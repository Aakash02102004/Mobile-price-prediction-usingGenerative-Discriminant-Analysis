# Mobile-price-prediction-usingGenerative-Discriminant-Analysis
This repository contains an implementation of Generative Discriminant Analysis (GDA) for classifying mobile phones into price ranges based on features like RAM and internal memory. Inspired by Andrew Ng’s ML course, this project applies probabilistic classification to a real-world dataset.  Key Highlights: ✔ 71% Accuracy using GDA
